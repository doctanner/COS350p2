SETUP: - IMPORTANT -

Please use the command "SETUP" or "make" to setup the support material.


NOTES:

This variation of my z827 project is flattened to one directory for use with
the "submit" program. Code and executable file are available without unpacking,
but support features will not be functional.

Please run the SETUP script directly or with the command "make" to properly
package the support materials. Once the SETUP script runs, the directory should
be in the state described in readme.PACK and hard-copy submission.

If the script fails for any reason, the support material can be unpacked
manually using the following commands:

mkdir support
mv *.txt* support/
mv *Script support/
mv makefile.PACK makefile
mv readme.PACK README
chmod +x support/*Script

This makes the support directory, copies the test source files, and copies the
scripts. It then replaces the SETUP makefile and README with the z827 makefile
and README. Finally, it makes the scripts executable.

Additionally, the script erases itself when complete to prevent accidentally
running it again. This leaves the directory in exactly the state described in
the z827 README.
