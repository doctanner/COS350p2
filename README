AUTHORS:
James Tanner: z827.c, testing suite, makefile, and README.
James Tanner and Rachel Champoux: man page

Note: (Tanner) Rachel and I intended to work on this project together.
However, scheduling conflicts meant we couldn't work on the code together. So,
we wrote the program itself separately but with collaboration. As such, many
parts of the code are quite similar.

The man page was written collaboratively.
The testing suite, writeup generator, and makefile are my work.

PURPOSE:
COS 350: Systems Programming
Program 2

MAN PAGE:
The command "man ./manpage" will display the attached manpage in standard
format. This command is also included in the makefile and can be executed with
the command "make man".

CONTENTS:
This directory should contain the following:
* z827.c
* makefile
* manpage
* README
* support/writeScript
* support/shake.txt
* support/short.txt
* support/short.txt.z827.referenceSoln
* support/words.txt
* support/testScript

The following files can be genrated:
* writeUp - Made by "make writeup"
* testResult - Made by "make test" or "make testResult"

TESTING:
The support directory contains a script and reference files for use in testing.
When running the test script, the working directory must be the root project
directory. (The directory this file is located in.)
It can be executed using either of the following commands:

   "support/testScript"
      - or -
   "make test"

Note: The latter is recommended as it also recompiles the executable if any
changes have been made.

MAKEFILE:
The makefile provides the following commands:
* make: Compiles the application and dependancies.
* make testResult: Compiles the application and runs the included test script.
* make test: Displays the test results from make testResult, generating new
  results if necessary.
* make man: Outputs the attached man page.
* make writeUp: Generates and displays the writeUp document.
* make print: Prints the last writeUp file using a2ps to the default printer.
  If no writeUp exists, this command generates a new one.
* make clean: Removes object files created during compilation, but leaves
  executable intact.
* make erase: Resets project directory by erasing object files, executable,
  testResult and writeUp.
* make flat: Flattens the directory structure to a single level, disabling
  all support features in the process. Can be undone with "make".

DEVIATIONS:
z827 deviates from the specification only in that it prints some output
to stdout while it is running. Specifically, it prints whether it is running
in compression or decompression mode and alerts when the process is complete.

EXTRA FEATURES:
Input and output streams are buffered to read() and write() in blocks of 512
bytes. Testing shows this improves performance by roughly 6.5 times.

Also, some additional supporting features are provided, including:
* makefile
* testing suite
* written part generator
Note: all of these features are accessable via "make [option]" commands.
(See "MAKEFILE" above.)

BUGS:
See man page for any known bugs/issues with the z827 program.
The man page may be accessed via "man ./manpage" or "make manpage" commands.
