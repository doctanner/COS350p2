TESTING:
The testing directory contains a script and reference files for use in testing.
When running the test script, the working directory must be the root project
directory. (The directory this file is located in.)
It can be executed using either of the following commands:

   "testing/ztest"
      - or -
   "make test"

Note: The latter is recommended, as it also recompiles the executable if any
changes have been made.

MAKEFILE:
The makefile provides the following commands:
* make: Compiles the application and dependancies.
* make test: Compiles the application and runs the included test script.
* make man: Outputs the attached man page.
* make clean: Removes object files created during compilation, but leaves
  executable intact. Also removes testResult file from "make test".
* make erase: Removes object files and executable.
