AUTHORS:
James Tanner: z827.c, testing suite, makefile, and README.
James Tanner and Rachel Champoux: man page

Note: (Tanner) Rachel and I intended to work on this project together.
However, scheduling conflicts meant we couldn't work on the code together. So,
we wrote the program itself separately, but with collaboration. As such, many
parts of the code are quite similar.

The man page was written collaboratively.
The testing suite and make file are my work.

PURPOSE:
COS 350: Systems Programming
Program 2

MAN PAGE:
The command "man ./manpage" will display the attached manpage in standard
format. This command is also included in the makefile and can be executed with
the command "make man".

CONTENTS:
This directory should contain the following:
* z827.c
* makefile
* manpage
* README
* testing/shake.txt
* testing/short.txt
* testing/short.txt.z827.referenceSoln
* testing/words.txt
* testing/ztest

TESTING:
The testing directory contains a script and reference files for use in testing.
When running the test script, the working directory must be the root project
directory. (The directory this file is located in.)
It can be executed using either of the following commands:

   "testing/ztest"
      - or -
   "make test"

Note: The latter is recommended, as it also recompiles the executable if any
changes have been made.

MAKEFILE:
The makefile provides the following commands:
* make: Compiles the application and dependancies.
* make test: Compiles the application and runs the included test script.
* make man: Outputs the attached man page.
* make clean: Removes object files created during compilation, but leaves
  executable intact. Also removes testResult file from "make test".
* make erase: Removes object files and executable.
