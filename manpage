.SH NAME
z827 - compress and decompress text files.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B z827 "filepath"

.SH DESCRIPTION
z827 uses the z827 algorithm to compress and decompress text files.
If the filepath does not end in ".z827", the file is passed through
the compression algorithm. If it does, then the file is passed through
decompression.

Compressed files saved to the same filepath appended with ".z827".
Decompressed files are saved to the same filepath with ".z827" removed.
If the compression or decompression succeeds, the original file is
deleted.

.SH EXAMPLES
z827 myText.txt - Compress the file "myText.txt".

z827 mytext.txt.z827 - Decompress the resulting file.
