.SH NAME
z827 - compress and decompress text files.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B z827 
.I filepath

.SH DESCRIPTION
z827 uses the z827 algorithm to compress and decompress text files.
If the filepath does not end in ".z827", the file is passed through
the compression algorithm. If it does, then the file is passed through
decompression.

Compressed files are saved to the same filepath appended with ".z827".
Decompressed files are saved to the same filepath with ".z827" removed.
If the compression or decompression succeeds, the original file is
deleted.

z827 compresses files by deleting the high order 8th bit, which is always
0 for ACII characters. This is done by taking a byte into a buffer and 
shifting the next byte to the left, overriding the high order bit.

z827 decompresses files by undoing the compression operation. It takes
four characters at a time into a buffer. It masks the high order bit
and outputs the first character. Then, using shifting operations, the first
character is pushed off the end of the buffer and the second character is 
pushed into place. When three of the four characters have been written,
the buffer is refilled. This continues while there are bits in the buffer
to be written and the amount written to output is less than the size
of the original file. 

.SH EXAMPLES
z827 myText.txt - Compress the file "myText.txt".

z827 mytext.txt.z827 - Decompress the resulting file.

.SH OPTIONS
No options available.

.SH NOTES
z827 only compressed files consisting entirely of ASCII characters.

.SH BUGS
No known bugs. It is, however, possible to compress non-ASCII files, provided
the 8th bit of all bytes in the files is 0. While the resulting file can be
decompressed as normal, this is considered incorrect behavior and can not be
gauranteed.

.SH MESSAGES AND EXIT CALLS
z827 will throw an error if no file is given or if there are too many 
arguments given. 
An error is thrown if the file does not exist or can't 
be opened.
